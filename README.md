# fuse-example-organizing-js-files
Example project to accompany the "[Organizing JS Files](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AoCdAKPLn4)" Fuse tutorial video. This is a super simple app that shows a few common cases for splitting up JS into multiple module files in Fuse.

## Fuse version
This example was produced with Fuse (beta) v0.11.0 (build 6183).

## Branches
The "finished product" is on the `master` branch, and the template I started with in the video is on the `starting-template` branch.
